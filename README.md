# A DS 4002 Case Study by Erin Moulton 
# Hook and Rubric Documents
The hook outlining the trajectory of the case study is located in this repository labeled, "CS3Hook.pdf". The rubric, "CS3Rubric.pdf" outlines the case study goal, expected deliverables, and submission requirements.

# Data 
The data necessary to conduct this case study is located within the "Materials" folder labeled "DATA". This contains the process to retrieve the intial dataset as well as a downloadable file of the final, refined dataset. The dataset contains Billboard Top 100 data since 1958 which I retrieved from the GitHub User, HipsterVizNinja: https://github.com/HipsterVizNinja/random-data/tree/main/Music/hot-100 

# Materials 

Within the "Materials" folder you will also find the Scripts folder. The "SCRIPTS" folder contains the Collab Notebook Python code necessary to complete the case study. 

Also within the "Materials" folder, there is materials to familiarze the student to the case study. First, "2016: A Year of Progress For Music" is a blog post reflecting on the signficant growth the American music industry saw in 2016 due to the rise of streaming. Next, "A Guide to TIme Series Analysis in Python," serves as a detailed guide explaining the key concepts behind time series analysis. Lastly, "Trend Changepoints," provides information on how to implement changepoints into your time series analysis project. Each of these pieces will be helpful to the student conducting this case study.
